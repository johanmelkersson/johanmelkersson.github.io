                        The seventh project at TGA and the third one using Crowsnest (our group’s game engine). An extremely fun project to be working on. 
                        The parodic, over-the-top hero and setting inspired by ”Dog the Bounty Hunter” and ”The Fifth Element” really speak to me. 
                        Aside from being a part of the PhysX integration in this project, I have done a lot of small tasks everywhere. Some of them connected to PhysX, 
                        like explosions, ground checks, raycasts for shooting, bullets, and missiles. I have also implemented the checkpoint system, kill triggers, 
                        and a small scripted event that lets you change music, and so on. In addition to this, I’m also responsible for the main menu, pause menu, and HUD.

                        The sixth project at TGA and my second one using Crowsnest (our group’s game engine). In this project, I developed the enemy AI, which consists of one lighter melee zombie 
                        enemy and one heavier ranged frost mage. Both enemies also have one basic and one elite version with different stats and somewhat different behavior. I enjoyed this project 
                        mainly because I got to work with something I really like, which is state machines and AI. This game, and some of the structural flaws in our system, is probably the reason 
                        I chose to specialize in the subject.

                        The fifth project at TGA and my first in Crowsnest, an engine created and developed by the students in our group. In this project, my main contribution was creating 
                        the player controller and movement for our hero. It was a pretty straightforward implementation where the player can look around the room and choose new positions or 
                        focus on objects by clicking on them. The camera then animates to the new position. The most challenging part during the development was getting all the rotations to work, 
                        mainly due to the fact that the engine at this stage was in a pretty basic state. Also, lerping and matching up the camera rotation before entering the animation phase of 
                        the movement took some tweaking to get right.
